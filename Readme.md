SOLID

Single responsibility principle: 
    focused, single functionality that addresses a specific concern

Open close principle:
    (Classes, Modules, Methods etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

Liskov Substitution Principle:
    We should be able to substitute base class object with child class object and this should not alter
    characteristics of program
